## Growing up
Born in a small town named "Udalguri" in Assam, India, I was always a reserved guy, introverted in nature. Childhood passed with me picking up all kinds of activities that I found my peers are doing such as painting and sports. Football, Cricket, Chess and Table Tennis were the ones that I enjoyed the most. I remember getting excited for Sundays so that we could play a 10 over cricket match against our rivals ðŸ˜….  Also, managed to win some Table Tennis competitions in my early days.


## Education
Completed my 12th(Higher Secondary) in 2012. Went on to pursue Engineering in Computer Science. Then, I received my B.E(Bachelor of Engineering) in Computer science in the year 2016. Following which, I felt, I could push myself to do Masters since it just takes 2 years. So, I prepared and got myself in Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad(now Prayagraj) for M.Tech (Master of Technology) specializing in Human Computer Interaction and completed it in the year 2018.

## Work
After completing my education, I have been working as a Frontend Developer since 2018. Surprisingly, being an introvert, I feel like this is the perfect job for me. Have been enjoying what I'm doing as a developer. Exploring new technologies around my domain has always been exciting for me.
