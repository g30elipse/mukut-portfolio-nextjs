All the paintings that I do are done digitally, in Procreate(iPad). It was during COVID pandemic(2019-2021) that I decided to dedicate some of my free time to learning painting. It was one of the best decisions in my life. It helped me remain calm and composed. Also, helped me get out of stressful situations. Now, when I look back, I feel very happy with the progress that I've made(although small) and hopefully continue to.

**PS: I do not have a background in art.**
